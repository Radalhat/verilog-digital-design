# Multiplexer (Behavioral Modeling)

## Overview

This folder contains the behavioral implementation of multiplexers using Verilog HDL.

The designs use behavioral modeling to demonstrate how different input signals are selected and routed to a single output using select lines. I created these projects to understand how multiplexers work and to become more comfortable writing Verilog code.

## Multiplexer

A multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational logic circuit that selects one input from multiple input signals and transfers the selected input to a single output. The selection is controlled by one or more select lines.

The following multiplexer designs are included:

* 2×1 Multiplexer
* 4×1 Multiplexer
* 8×1 Multiplexer

## Design

The multiplexers are implemented using behavioral modeling with `always @(*)` blocks.

Each design is tested with different input and select line combinations to verify that the correct input is routed to the output.

## Summary

Working on these designs helped me understand how multiplexers select and route data and how behavioral modeling is used to describe combinational circuits in Verilog.
